            <p class="line">All in a large ass pot, cook until all meat is browned.</p><p class="line">Comments: The cabbage volumizes the 1kg of meat to resemble 2kg of meat and itself contributes no real taste or scent of it&apos;s own. The final product is a slightly tomato flavored pile of meat and whatever else you added. Its amazing for a cutting diet as you get boatloads of fiber and protein for little calories. Very filling and cheap to make. If you&apos;re bulking you can add beans, although make sure to soak them as the cooking method here is not conducive to deactivating the phytohaemagglutinin (lectin) content of the beans, but actually exacerbates the activity if not pre-soaked. If you want to get fancy you can also just put it on top of some other steamed veggies as a caloric &apos;sauce&apos; of sorts. If you want to have some more calories just put some of the meat slop into a wrap with some cheese.</p><p class="line">https://imgur.com/a/meat-slop-v2-0-american-chili-style-ptgTRsa</p><p class="line">Thanks for the video! Here&apos;s another slightly different recipe that should taste better. My girl actually will eat this version with me for dinner. Every addition is somewhat optional. This is what I cook in one large frying pan. I usually double the recipe and do two at a time. Invest in a sharp knife or a little chopper.<br/><strong>For one pan:</strong><br/>Salt  Pepper Cumin Chili powder Brown sugar<br/>1.5 lbs ground beef per pan 1 Can tomato paste 1 Can seasoned chili beans include broth Half tiny can green chili peppers Half tiny can hot jalapeños  Yellow beets  Sweet peppers <br/>Quarter head cabbage Nearly half a red onion Yellow or red beet (cut red small cause they can be hard even cooked) Mushrooms Sweet peppers<br/>White wine vinegar Half cup water<br/>Mexican mixed shredded cheese (optional) Wraps<br/>Instructions Dice everything and mix it all together in a big pan.  You don&apos;t need to drain the meat.  Cook for around half hour on medium. Just make sure the meat cooks and the veggies are soft. Add brown sugar and spices towards end of cook <br/>Keep adding water as needed to cook/boil it<br/>You can drain it after cooking if needed. Eat plain or put into wraps with a bit of cheese (optional) I reuse the cans I opened to store and freeze the leftovers. As with any food, try to cool it before putting into fridge/freezer or it can warm up and spoil your other food in there</p><br/><p class="line">For those who care to know: For a different flavor, the additives can be switched up. Like for an asian flavor, use kimchi (replacing cabbage, or use in addition to…Kimchi, btw, it’s a good digestive), shiitake mushrooms, baby bok choy, bamboo shoots, ginger, garlic and liquid aminos (I have coconut-based liquid aminos because the popular brand liquid aminos, Bragg’s, is soy-based and I HATE soy!). For an Eastern Bloc flavor, use saurkraut (replacing, or in addition to cabbage), paprika (smoked sweet paprika if you’ve got it), black pepper, roasted garlic, red/green bell peppers, fresh parsley, maybe add kielbasa and a little caraway seed. Diced turnip/rutabaga can be added if you have a jones for potatoes but can’t/won’t eat them for whatever reason. I’m sure it doesn’t need mention: vegetables should be added absolutely LAST, after you’ve already got a good meat pot a-bubblin’, for texture &amp; nutritional reasons. Kimchi and kraut can be found real cheap at your local ethnic market.</p>
